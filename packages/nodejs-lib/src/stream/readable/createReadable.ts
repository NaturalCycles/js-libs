/**
 * Convenience function to create a Readable that can be pushed into (similar to RxJS Subject).
 * Push `null` to it to complete (similar to RxJS `.complete()`).
 *
 * Difference from Readable.from() is that this readable is not "finished" yet and allows pushing more to it.
 *
 * Caution!
 * The implementation of this Readable is not fully compliant,
 * e.g the read() method doesn't return anything, so, it will hang the Node process (or cause it to process.exit(0))
 * if read() will be called AFTER everything was pushed and Readable is closed (by pushing `null`).
 * Beware of it when e.g doing unit testing! Jest prefers to hang (not exit-0).
